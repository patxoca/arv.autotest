* in TerminalReactor: factor in its own method the construction of the
  stamp.

* add plugins:

  * a package can declare reporters, event filters etc. using entry
    points.

  * the user specifies what reporter/filter/... to use in the config
    file.

* add optional 'command' to watches: use case, if a 'test_*.py' file
  changes run only tests on that file, otherwise run all tests.
