* test_filters does not check that simple_event_filter_factory returns
  False if the event is neither excluded nor included.

* in TerminalReactor: factor in its own method the construction of the
  stamp.

* TerminalReactor: seem like sys.stdout is not a tty and the width is
  always 80

* config._parse_config: '_parse_config' is roughly equivalent to:

        _parse_config = V.make_validator_from_schema(SCHEMA)

  Probably there are duplicated tests.

* utils.TypedObject.__getattr__: I think that

        if name not in self._validators:
            raise AttributeError(name)
        value = self._values.get(name)

  may be replaced with:

        value = self._values.get(name, NoDefault)

* validators.make_validator_from_schema: according to coverage line 35
  is not executed but there is a test for a failing validation (???)

* as the architecture evolves the original names get mealingless,
  choose better names for modules, classes etc.
